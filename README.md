**Business Problem**

1.1 Problem Description

Netflix aims to connect people with movies they love by providing personalized recommendations. To achieve this, they developed a sophisticated recommendation system called CinematchSM. This system predicts whether a user will enjoy a movie based on their preferences and previous interactions, enabling Netflix to offer tailored movie suggestions that align with each customer's unique taste.

While Cinematch has been effective, there is always room for improvement. Numerous alternative methods, some documented in research and others yet unexplored, may potentially outperform Cinematch by providing more accurate predictions. Exploring these approaches could significantly enhance customer satisfaction and have a positive impact on Netflix's business.

1.2 Problem Statement:

Netflix has supplied a large dataset of anonymous movie ratings along with a benchmark for prediction accuracyâ€”set 10% higher than what Cinematch achieves on the same training dataset. (Accuracy measures how closely the predicted movie ratings align with the actual ratings provided later.)
